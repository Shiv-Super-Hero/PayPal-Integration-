The PayPal Payment Integration Service is a Spring Boot application designed to facilitate non-stop payment processing using the PayPal API. It provides endpoints to initiate payments, handle payment approvals, and manage payment cancellations or errors. By leveraging the PayPal Java SDK, the application constructs payment requests specifying details such as amount, currency, payment method, and descriptions. Users are redirected to PayPal for approval, after which the application processes the payment and updates the transaction status accordingly. This integration ensures secure and efficient payment handling within the application.
